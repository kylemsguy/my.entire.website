Today, I was suffering through (what is hopefully) my last exam. Today, I'm flying to Japan for a 17 day trip, followed by a 3 day trip to Seoul, Korea. I'm accompanied by a couple of my friends from university.

We plan on spending about a week in Tokyo, before heading over to Kyoto and Osaka. Our plans aren't really set in stone, but it's sure to be a fun trip. None of us speak any Japanese, but I guess we'll have to make do. I plan on meeting up with another friend (who graduated last year) who lives in Japan, and I hope that he'll be able to show us around. 

Anyways, time for the 12-hour flight over the Arctic. See you tomorrow (i.e. in a few hours I suppose).
