So a few days ago, [SplatHeX](http://leanny.github.io/SplatHeX.html) was released. 
For the uninitiated, SplatHeX is a save editor for Splatoon 2 that was created by [LeanYoshi](https://twitter.com/leanyoshi). In its current incarnation, it's still quite limited, only letting the user edit gear and single player attributes. However, over the past couple of days, there has been discussion on whether this constitues cheating in a tournament setting. This was sparked by a [statement from InkTV](https://twitter.com/Flarablitz/status/996591488598532096) that states that SplatHeX is a form of cheating, and is therefore banned from BnS tournaments **if discovered.** The reason why this statement is so controversial requires some context from Splatoon 1.

In Splatoon, the clothing the player chooses for their Inkling gives certain abilities. This is dictated by its permanent main ability (the larger icon). and its three sub abilities. Main abilities (except for main-only gear abilities such as Ninja Squid or Tenacity) are worth just over 3 sub abilities in terms of effectiveness. Having the right combinations of main and sub abilities is crucial for optimal performance during a match.

Back in Splatoon 1, however, building gearsets was a nightmare. While the main ability was easy to get (simply buy the gear with the ability), the sub abilities are randomly selected as the gear is levelled up (biased towards certain abilities due to the gear's brand, but that's not important). To make things worse, the only way to change these abilities was to reroll them by talking to Spyke, and this either costs 30,000 coins (only if you're level 20), or one Super Sea Snail. This is the biggest problem with building gearsets in Splatoon 1--the only way to get the abilities you want is to keep rerolling gear until the stars align, and you get the sub abilities you want. Since this is random, and there is such a high cost per reroll, it can get extremely tedious to reroll until you get the gear that you want. Early on, save scumming was used to ameliorate the cost of rerolls, but this meant that people were spending hours rerolling gear that they could be using to play the game, and improve. 

In comes [Splathax](https://gbatemp.net/threads/splatoon-modding-hub.425670/). Since a public kernel exploit was released for the Wii U during the lifetime of Splatoon, people have developed ways to mod the game by attaching a debugger. This allows for changing or disabling the background music without affecting the sound effects ([MusicRandomizer](https://github.com/OatmealDome/MusicRandomizer)), rapid fire, god mode, or instant painting hacks. The hack that enabled gear editing was Splathax. This meant that people no longer needed to endlessly reroll gear, but instead could build all the combinations of gear they could ever want, with only a short one-time time investment. This was extremely helpful since the only alternative at the time was to leave it up to chance, and waste tons of time rerolling gear.

With Splatoon 2, Nintendo addressed this problem by introducing Gear Chunks. When gear is levelled up, the sub abilities are still determined randomly (again, with a bias towards certain abilities due to brands), except that now, Murch will allow you to "scrub" your gear for 20,000 coins. This allows these sub abilities to become Gear Chunks, which can be used later to manually install the abilities. It takes 10 chunks to install an ability alone, 20 if there's already one of the same ability on the gear, and 30 if there are already two. This takes enough of the randomness out of the process that people are not spending hours rerolling, but encouraging people to play the game more to get the chunks that they want. Rerolling still exists, but each time a gear item is rerolled, the old abilities are returned to the player as chunks.
