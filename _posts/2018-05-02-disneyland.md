My, today was a long and eventful day.

We got up later than previously(but earlier than yesterday), and microwaved the food we bought from 7-eleven yesterday for breakfast. Once we finished breakfast, we made our way to Shinjuku-Gyoemmae station to catch the Marunouchi Line, as our first leg of the journey. Since I was pretty tired, I wasn't really paying attention to where we were going since one of my friends was doing most of the navigation..
